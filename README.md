# HR-Analytics
This project focuses on analysing employee attendance data to provide HR teams with a clear, data-driven view of on-site presence, work-from-home (WFH), and sick leave (SL) patterns. The goal was to transform raw attendance records into actionable, easy-to-consume insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.
